<h1>Simple Quiz app made with only vanilla HTML, CSS and JS</h1>
<p>This project is a front-end web application created to practice fundamental web development concepts using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. It aims to build a functional quiz application operating entirely within the browser, and an attempt of an SPA.</p>

<h2>Functionality</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Data persistence for users and scores is handled using the browser's localStorage.</li>
  <li>User Authentication: Provides Login and Register forms. User credentials (email/password) are stored and checked against localStorage.</li>
  <li>Quiz Selection: Authenticated users are presented with a list of available quizzes.</li>
  <li>Quiz Interface: Users can select a quiz, answer multiple-choice questions via radio buttons, and submit their responses.</li>
  <li>Scoring: Calculates the user's score upon submission and displays the result as a percentage. Scores are saved to localStorage, associated with the user's email.</li>
  <li>Admin Dashboard: A basic view accessible with hardcoded credentials (admin@quiz.com / admin123) displaying registered users and their saved quiz scores.</li>
  <li>SPA Simulation: Uses CSS display properties to show/hide different sections (div elements acting as pages), avoiding full page reloads for navigation.</li>
</ul>
